DMineur

A naive attempt at making a Minesweeper clone (how naive you say ? It uses system("CLS")) made in the D programming language. Hence the name : D-mineur. Get it ? Get it ? :D

Type DMineur.exe --help for a brief howto.
To build from the source you will need the DMD 2 compiler, which can be downloaded from dlang.org :

	dmd -O -release DMineur.d logic.d

Enjoy !
